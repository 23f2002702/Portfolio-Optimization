# ðŸ“Š Portfolio Optimization using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)

This project uses **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** to construct, analyze, and optimize stock portfolios using real stock data. It includes enhancements such as Monte Carlo simulation, Sharpe Ratio maximization, log returns, risk metrics (VaR, CVaR), rebalancing strategies, and Capital Market Line (CML) analysis.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Historical data download via `yfinance`
- âœ… Random portfolio generation
- âœ… Sharpe Ratio maximization using `scipy.optimize`
- âœ… Efficient Frontier visualization
- âœ… Monte Carlo simulation with 5000+ portfolios
- âœ… Capital Market Line (CML) and Tangency Portfolio
- âœ… Real-world risk metrics:  
  - Alpha, Beta  
  - Max Drawdown  
  - Sortino Ratio  
  - VaR (Value at Risk)  
  - CVaR (Expected Shortfall)
- âœ… Monthly rebalancing vs. buy-and-hold strategy comparison
- âœ… Covariance shrinkage using Ledoit-Wolf estimator
- âœ… Benchmarking vs. S&P 500 (SPY)

ðŸ“Œ Notes
Make sure you're connected to the internet when running the notebook (for data fetching).

The notebook assumes equity tickers from Yahoo Finance (like AAPL, MSFT, etc.).

Returns are log-transformed for compounding accuracy.
